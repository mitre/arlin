ARLIN
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Model Interrogation
=================================

**ARLIN** is an open-source Python library for researchers within both the explainable
AI (XAI) and adversarial AI (AdvAI) fields. It utilizes 
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/>`_ and 
`networkx <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/>`_ to create meaningful metric 
visualizations for researchers to identify vulnerabilities within trained reinforcement
learning (RL) models and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API along with a *modular* 
code architecture.

.. note::
   This project is under active development through 2023 under the Decision Science ECRP.
